Hey there 👋

I'm **Insany**, an information security specialist and C developer.

I design and build low-level security tools and terminal-first utilities,
with a focus on predictability, minimal dependencies, and offline operation.
My work centers around systems programming and security tooling
that can be audited, reasoned about, and deployed without external services.

### Areas of focus
- Low-level security tooling in **C**
- Linux internals and system hardening
- Reverse engineering and binary analysis
- Minimal, auditable CLI utilities
- 
### Engineering principles
- Simple tools that do one thing well  
- No unnecessary abstractions  
- No hidden APIs or cloud dependencies  
- Security should be understandable, not magical  
> If a tool requires internet access, it increases the attack surface.

### Facts about me 
I line to dig deeper into a technology to understand how it works from the inside.
