I'm **Insany**.

Information security specialist and C developer.

I build low-level security tools and terminal-first utilities,  
with a focus on simplicity, auditability, and offline operation.

**Areas of work**
- Systems programming in C  
- Linux security and internals  
- Reverse engineering  
- Minimal CLI tooling  

**Current focus**
- Offline-first security utilities  
- Predictable, dependency-free tooling  

Pinned repositories reflect my active work.
